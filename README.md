### My name is Ziyu Song (id: dzuhyoosg).

I am currently a master’s student studying **Information Systems** and **Applied Information Science** at **Cornell Tech** (Cornell University). Concentration in Health Tech with a Computer Science Specialization (Technion).

👩🏻‍🎓 I graduated from the University of Rochester studying **Data Science** (B.S.) with minors in Legal Studies and Statistics, cluster in French. Concentration in Political Science.
