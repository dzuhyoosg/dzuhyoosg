### My name is Ziyu Song (Dzuh-yoo-sg).

I am currently a master’s student studying **Information Systems** and **Applied Information Science** at **Cornell Tech** (Cornell University). Concentration in Health Tech with a Computer Science Specialization (Technion).

👩🏻‍🎓 I graduated from the University of Rochester studying Data Science (B.S.) with minors in Legal Studies and Statistics, cluster in French. Concentration in Political Science. 

💻 I am interested in using strategies to enlarge the customer-facing value of various technology products, solving problems using a wide range of technological solutions effectively, legally and ethically. 

🌟 I enjoy roles that are challenging and diverse. I have a strong curiosity about innovative things. I want to learn more about them, develop effective products, and want to see what I could do in the field, how can I contribute to it as a woman studying technology.
