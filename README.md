My name is Ziyu Song. 我是宋子钰。

I am currently a master’s student studying Information Systems and Applied Information Science at Cornell Tech (Cornell University). Concentration in Health Tech. 

I graduated from the University of Rochester studying Data Science (B.S.) with minors in Legal Studies and Statistics, cluster in French. Concentration in Political Science. 👩🏻‍🎓

💻 I am interested in using strategies to enlarge the customer-facing value of various technology products, solving problems using a wide range of technological solutions. Meanwhile, as the only one in my B.S. Data Science graduating class who studied Legal Studies, I developed a habit to not just use technology effectively, but also legally and ethically.

🌟 I enjoy roles that are challenging and diverse. I have a strong curiosity about innovative things. I want to learn more about them, develop effective products, and want to see what I could do in the field, how can I contribute to it as a woman studying technology.
